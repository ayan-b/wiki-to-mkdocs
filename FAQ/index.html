You need to come up with an efficient enough algorithm and then implement it in your language of choice. Some examples are solving Sudoku grid or maybe finding the shortest way to get from one city to the other. There is some input specified (like an array of size at most 500000) and your function should return or print the answer.</p> <p>It’s a sport that some people are very passionate about and devote a lot of time for. Best competitive programmers are often good in maths, chess and board games - just analytical thinking in general.</p> <p>Big competitions are organized or sponsored by companies that try to find and hire talented programmers. Since coding interviews are often about algorithms, a lot of people do some CP just to pass an interview. This creates demand and supply for CP but it will never be as popular as e-sports or standards sports like football because it isn't interesting to watch.</p> <p>Read more about CP <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_programming>here</a>.</p> <h2 id=why-two-youtube-channels-errichto-and-errichto-2>Why two Youtube channels, Errichto and Errichto 2?<a class=headerlink href=#why-two-youtube-channels-errichto-and-errichto-2 title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2> <p>The first channel has short well-prepared educational videos for casual programmers.

I would often be stuck for a long time. And I don't think it makes much sense to record anything without the commentary unless you are extremely good and it's just cool to watch it. I will keep making some problem-solving streams where I don't have time pressure, and let's leave screencasts to the very top competitors like Petr and Um_nik.</p> <h2 id=how-much-time-do-you-spend-on-programming-how-much-should-i-practice>How much time do you spend on programming? How much should I practice?<a class=headerlink href=#how-much-time-do-you-spend-on-programming-how-much-should-i-practice title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2> <p>If you are in school or university, it shouldn't be hard to find at least 10 hours per week to practice competitive programming. Perfectly, you should do 20 hours per week IMO. It's much harder when you have a job and/or a family. Then you are simply limited by your free time and that's fine - you don't have to hit some numbers. I currently spend a lot of time on competitive programming because it's my job, so maybe 30 hours a week, but I don't solve problems that much anymore. It used to be maybe 10 hours a week when I started.</p> <h2 id=what-is-boring-programming-stream-bps>What is Boring Programming Stream (BPS)?<a class=headerlink href=#what-is-boring-programming-stream-bps title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2> <p>My not-well-organized streams where I do random things, including reading articles on algorithms and also maintaining my Youtube channel, e.g. answering comments. Basically, boring stuff.</p> <p>In particular, BPS is not meant to be a lecture. If I read or talk about some topic, it's because I'm doing some research or I'm curious how it's explained by others on the Internet. Maybe I'm preparing a Youtube lecture myself.

I could make a paid course to make some money but I can reach more people on Youtube instead and I would feel that I need to spend a loooot of time to make the best possible product if somebody pays for it.

If you care so much about contests and your performance, use that to motivate you to practice more.

I do something I like and I’m happy with that. Working for Google is a dream for some people but not for everybody. The bigger the company, smaller is the impact you have yourself (you are a tiny cog in a huge machine). You are partially limited in what you can do - especially if you are not willing to relocate to another country. I have friends and family in Poland, so at least for now I want to stay here.

I did some short part-time working or an internship, and also rejected some offers. I was also offered normal full-time jobs.
