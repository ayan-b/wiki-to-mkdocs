We'll think which method is better to learn: iterative or resursive. Then harder problems in next lectures. Each lecture is some theory and some problems. A DP is an algorithmic technique which is usually based on a recurrent formula and one (or some) starting states. A sub-solution of the problem is constructed from previously found ones. DP solutions have a polynomial complexity which assures a much faster running time than other techniques like backtracking, brute-force etc. (that was a quote by Dumitru from TC). Most DP problems are about optimizing (min or max) certain value/quantity or about counting something, e.g. the number of ways to get from one vertex to the other, or the number of ways to write N as a sum of smaller values. We can also use it to check if something is possible and report YES/NO. In case of optimization or YES/NO problems, you should often consider a greedy approach first. It might give you a much easier solution but it's viable only in some problems and the correctness is often hard to prove. Some problems are a mix of two. The example is max-subarray sum (Kadane\u2019s algorithm). Wikipedia says that one of the reasons the word \"dynamic\" was used is that \"it sounded impressive\". Why iterative (bottom-up) over recursion (top-down)?

Sometimes recursion is better Visiting too many states. Given N, you can repeatedly divide it by 2 or 3. Count something? Recursion will get to some states only. When it's hard to figure out the order, e.g. in graphs. For DAG's, you can do topo-sort first. Fibonacci ( https://leetcode.com/problems/fibonacci-number/ ). This is similar to problems about \"counting ways\" but it's easier because we're just given the formula to use. Make a drawing (tree). Mention O(1) space solution. Mention factorial. Say something about overlapping subproblems and explain why DP isn't needed for factorial. Stairs: count ways to get from step 1 to N, if you can jump to one of next \u2154 steps ( https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs/ ). What if we can make at most K jumps? K is given, K <= N.

This set of parameters should be as small as possible to reduce state space. For example: In our famous Knapsack problem, we define our state by two parameters index and weight i.e DP[index][weight]. Here DP[index][weight] tells us the maximum profit it can make by taking items from range 0 to index having the capacity of sack to be weight. Therefore, here the parameters index and weight together can uniquely identify a subproblem for the knapsack problem. https://atcoder.jp/contests/dp/tasks/dp_d There will be a nice twist in the next lecture/video, where weights can be huge but values are small.

How to handle sadness after failure in a contest? 2) Personal \u00b6 Who are you? What language do you prefer? How old are you? What\u2019s your age? When did you start coding? Where do you live? Where are you from? What is your job? Why not Google, Facebook, etc.? Why don\u2019t you work for big companies? Have you ever thought of starting a business or a startup? Have you had some coding interviews? Did you apply for a job in a company? Are you still in the university? Do you have a degree? Have you participated in ICPC or IOI? How did you start with competitive programming? How old were you? What algorithms or topics do you like most? Do you personally know Radewoosh, mnbvmar, tourist, etc.? Why do you stream? Why did you decide to start streaming? Have you contributed to any open source projects? What languages do you speak? What are your hobbies? What's your WPM / typing speed? What is competitive programming (CP)? \u00b6 Competitive programming, also called sports programming, is a mind sport (just like chess) about quickly solving programming/algorithmic problems. You need to come up with an efficient enough algorithm and then implement it in your language of choice. Some examples are solving Sudoku grid or maybe finding the shortest way to get from one city to the other. There is some input specified (like an array of size at most 500000) and your function should return or print the answer. It\u2019s a sport that some people are very passionate about and devote a lot of time for. Best competitive programmers are often good in maths, chess and board games - just analytical thinking in general. Big competitions are organized or sponsored by companies that try to find and hire talented programmers. Since coding interviews are often about algorithms, a lot of people do some CP just to pass an interview. This creates demand and supply for CP but it will never be as popular as e-sports or standards sports like football because it isn't interesting to watch. Read more about CP here . Why two Youtube channels, Errichto and Errichto 2? \u00b6 The first channel has short well-prepared educational videos for casual programmers. The second one has streams, problem solving, and is mainly for the competitive programming community. Not everybody would enjoy a 5-hour boring stream where I write editorials. Computer configuration (OS, IDE, keyboard, etc.) \u00b6 I mainly use Linux (Ubuntu) and sometimes Windows because it has better software for streaming. Geany is my favorite IDE (why not Vim? I don\u2019t know how to use it). My setup is Blue Yeti microphone, camera Logitech C922, Wacom Intuos drawing tablet, Logitech UltraX Premium (old but amazing keyboard), M330 Silent Plus wireless mouse, and two iiyama ProLite XUB2492HSU-B1 monitors on a combined movable stand. How to practice topic X? How to be good at competitive programming? How to train? \u00b6 See \"How to practice?\" page, link . What is your IDE setup / Geany setup? \u00b6 See \"Linux setup\" page, link . How can I support you / the channel / the stream? Do you accept donations? \u00b6 Help me grow by telling your programmer friends about the channel. And you can give me suggestions for videos, streams or general ways to improve. I don't need donations. Feel free to support a charity of your choice instead. Social platforms? How can I contact you? \u00b6 Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/errichto Youtube 2: https://www.youtube.com/errichto2 Twitch: https://www.twitch.tv/errichto Discord: https://discordapp.com/invite/UzaURu7 Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/errichto Twitter: https://twitter.com/errichto (I don't reply to messages on Twitter, sorry about that) What is your Git / Github repository? \u00b6 https://github.com/Errichto/youtube Why don't you record contest screencasts like Petr? \u00b6 I'm not that good and my performance would tank if I did commentary in English during the contest. I would often be stuck for a long time. And I don't think it makes much sense to record anything without the commentary unless you are extremely good and it's just cool to watch it. I will keep making some problem-solving streams where I don't have time pressure, and let's leave screencasts to the very top competitors like Petr and Um_nik. How much time do you spend on programming? How much should I practice? \u00b6 If you are in school or university, it shouldn't be hard to find at least 10 hours per week to practice competitive programming. Perfectly, you should do 20 hours per week IMO. It's much harder when you have a job and/or a family. Then you are simply limited by your free time and that's fine - you don't have to hit some numbers. I currently spend a lot of time on competitive programming because it's my job, so maybe 30 hours a week, but I don't solve problems that much anymore. It used to be maybe 10 hours a week when I started. What is Boring Programming Stream (BPS)? \u00b6 My not-well-organized streams where I do random things, including reading articles on algorithms and also maintaining my Youtube channel, e.g. answering comments. Basically, boring stuff. In particular, BPS is not meant to be a lecture. If I read or talk about some topic, it's because I'm doing some research or I'm curious how it's explained by others on the Internet. Maybe I'm preparing a Youtube lecture myself. Anyway, I won't necessarily explain everything. Can you help me with a problem? How to solve this? \u00b6 Read Asking for help FAQ . Do you participate in Project Euler? \u00b6 No, I don't. They have hard math problems and I'm not that good in them. I enjoy standard algorithms more. I also don't recommend it that much unless you are experienced in math and want to improve even more. Will you write a book on algorithms or CP? \u00b6 Not likely. I'm not a good writer. I enjoy thinking about the best way to explain something though, so maybe I will coauthor something eventually. And it's a huge time commitment while I have a lot of things to do currently. Will you make a course on Udemy (free or paid)? \u00b6 I don't think that it's better than what I'm currently doing on Youtube. I could make a paid course to make some money but I can reach more people on Youtube instead and I would feel that I need to spend a loooot of time to make the best possible product if somebody pays for it. I would basically need to stop doing other things now. And Udemy takes a big cut of the money. What platforms do you recommend? \u00b6 Atcoder and Codeforces. For more info, refer to How to practice? . What to do when my rating doesn't grow? How to measure my progress? \u00b6 If you learn new things and you would solve a problem that you couldn't a month ago, you're fine. Rating is a bit random and it's ok to focus on solving problems. Make your goal to be some number of not-easy problems solved in a month, and focus on achieving that. What books do you recommend? Is Introduction to Algorithms good? \u00b6 Competitive Programmer's Handbook is great for beginners and it's a free PDF online, https://cses.fi/book/book.pdf . Generally, books aren't important and nowadays it's ok to just solve problems online, as long as they have editorials. When you can't solve a problem, read the editorial and you've just learned something new. How to practice math for CP? Is math important? \u00b6 Benq (IOI winner) answered this in detail: https://github.com/bqi343/USACO/blob/master/Resources/Competition%20Math.md My answer would be this: I have a strong math background from school, and it helps a lot in CP. I don't know which books or other resources are best if you want to catch up. Well, you can always get a book on combinatorics and go through it. How to handle sadness after failure in a contest? \u00b6 Feeling sad after a failure is natural and it gets better with time. If you care so much about contests and your performance, use that to motivate you to practice more. And remember that losing CF rating makes it only easier to gain rating in the next contest. Who are you? \u00b6 My name is Kamil D\u0119bowski (or Errichto) and I'm quite good at competitive programming. I'm a finalist of multiple big programming competitions like ICPC, Facebook Hacker Cup and Google Code Jam (even got 2 nd place in 2018). I also organize competitions, which means inventing and preparing problems. What language do you prefer? \u00b6 C++. It is very efficient and thus most popular in competitive programming. I also know some Java and Python. How old are you? What\u2019s your age? When did you start coding? \u00b6 I was born 1995. I was 13 when I wrote my first code, and 15 when I started doing competitive programming. Where do you live? Where are you from? \u00b6 I live in Warsaw, Poland. What is your job? \u00b6 I teach programming. I organize competitions and workshops and I'm interested in algo/programming education in general. I give private coaching but I'm not accepting new students (so don't ask me about it). I make videos and streams for Youtube and Twitch. Maybe it will be a source of income for me one day. Why not Google, Facebook, etc.? Why don\u2019t you work for big companies? \u00b6 Why should I? I do something I like and I\u2019m happy with that. Working for Google is a dream for some people but not for everybody. The bigger the company, smaller is the impact you have yourself (you are a tiny cog in a huge machine). You are partially limited in what you can do - especially if you are not willing to relocate to another country. I have friends and family in Poland, so at least for now I want to stay here. There aren't a lot of possibilities in Warsaw office of Google. Have you ever thought of starting a business or a startup? \u00b6 Yes, it's something very exciting to me. My strength is algorithms knowledge so it will likely be something related to programming camps or online courses. Have you had some coding interviews? Did you apply for a job in a company? \u00b6 Yes, I did and I actually have 100% acceptance so far (5 out of 5, I think), which surprises me because I didn't know some basic stuff a few years ago like unit testing or language-specific details. I did some short part-time working or an internship, and also rejected some offers. I was also offered normal full-time jobs. I didn't try any big company so far though. Are you still in the university? Do you have a degree? \u00b6 No, but I tried a few fields: maths, CS and economics. Each time I hated some subjects. I eventually decided to just pursue a career without graduating. I still visit maths&informatics faculty of the University of Warsaw to attend some extra lectures or ICPC trainings/contests. I still hang out most with people from maths&informatics faculty of the University of Warsaw. Have you participated in ICPC or IOI? \u00b6 I started doing CP quite late, so in high school I wasn't good enough to get to IOI. I did participate in ICPC though. I got a bronze medal (12 th place) in 2015 and didn\u2019t get a medal in 2018 (14 th place), which was a disaster for me because we were one of the best teams and we fought for the win. How did you start with competitive programming? How old were you? \u00b6 I was good in maths and a friend told about POI (Polish olympiad) so I checked the problems out and was able to solve some in a few days (the first stage lasts for a month). I was 15. I learnt from Polish websites because I didn\u2019t know English well. My skills greatly improved by reading Cormen\u2019s Introduction to Algo but I don\u2019t recommend it. It\u2019s outdated and there are better resources. If you want a book, read Competitive Programmer\u2019s Handbook . What algorithms or topics do you like most? \u00b6 Ad-hoc, dp, geometry, combinatorics and probability. I don't like graphs, strings and number theory. Do you personally know Radewoosh, mnbvmar, tourist, etc.? \u00b6 Yes. I know all competitive programmers from Poland and many from abroad. Why do you stream? Why did you decide to start streaming? \u00b6 I like teaching and I think I'm quite good at explaining stuff. There isn't a lot of video content on algorithms and competitive programming, so I can fill the niche. I don't earn money from Youtube and Twitch currently, but maybe eventually it will be my source of income. Have you contributed to any open source projects? \u00b6 No, I haven't. I'm not really that good software engineer. My coding skills (like style of code and knowledge of libraries) are not better than an average programmer. Instead, I contribute by making educational content and teaching for free. What languages do you speak? \u00b6 Only Polish and English. I know the Russian alphabet (Cyrillic) and some words - mainly those that are the same in Polish. These two languages are quite similar. What are your hobbies? \u00b6 Other than programming, I'm a quite casual person. I watch movies and tv series. I used to play chess, poker and volleyball. I like board games, e.g. Splendor and 7 Wonders. I have a PS4 for its amazing exclusives like Uncharted and The Last of Us. I read a book from time to time. The Witcher saga rules, and so does the Witcher 3 game. The last game I played (as of February 2020) is Frostpunk. What's your WPM / typing speed? \u00b6 Around 80 WPM on average, and up to 110 WPM for very simple English words. There are free tools online if you want to practice fast typing.","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"FAQ/#frequently-asked-questions","text":"","title":"Frequently Asked Questions"},{"location":"FAQ/#1-programming-yt-channel","text":"What is competitive programming (CP)?

You need to come up with an efficient enough algorithm and then implement it in your language of choice. Some examples are solving Sudoku grid or maybe finding the shortest way to get from one city to the other. There is some input specified (like an array of size at most 500000) and your function should return or print the answer. It\u2019s a sport that some people are very passionate about and devote a lot of time for. Best competitive programmers are often good in maths, chess and board games - just analytical thinking in general. Big competitions are organized or sponsored by companies that try to find and hire talented programmers. Since coding interviews are often about algorithms, a lot of people do some CP just to pass an interview. This creates demand and supply for CP but it will never be as popular as e-sports or standards sports like football because it isn't interesting to watch.

How to practice? \u00b6 Everything below is written with competitive programming in mind, but practicing for coding interviews is similar. Your goal should be to get better at algorithms and data structures. Solve problems slightly above your level - those that aren't easy for you but you can usually solve them. If you are stuck for 20-30 minutes (an hour in case of harder problems), read an editorial and make sure you understand it. Implement a solution and if you struggled then go read other people's codes - see how they did it easier. Note the word \"stuck\" in bold. If you aren't out of ideas then you aren't stuck. You can give up only if you didn't do any progress for some time. Upsolve problems you didn't solve during a contest. Not all of them, just one-two more. Don't try something very hard because you likely won't solve it. You will eventually learn enough to tackle those hard problems. How to practice a particular topic? \u00b6 Use Google to find some tutorials and read them. Solve problems on that topic. After a while, go back to solving random problems. You should now be able to recognize similar problems and apply the new algorithm/technique you learned. For smaller algorithms/techniques, it's enough to solve a few problems to understand it well enough. In case of big topics (categories) like dynamic programming, you should solve tens of problems. But don't spend months on that because you cheat a little bit by knowing what you should use in a problem. When you read a problem during a contest, you don't know its tags/topics. Sometimes the hard part is to come up with what you should use. Recognizing patterns is a valuable skill and that's why you need to mainly solve random problems. What should I learn next? \u00b6 Just solve problems. If there is some algorithm you should know, you will eventually encounter it. Then search for some tutorials and similar problems.

For beginners, I recommend Codeforces educational rounds and Atcoder Beginner Contests (ABC). You will encounter a lot of standard problems and thus you will learn important techniques. The statements are not convoluted and that's another plus. There are no English editorials for ABC but you can use google translate from Japanese, or you can read submissions by people from the top.

My favorite IDE is Geany and it's perfect for short codes in CP, but I don't recommend it for work and big projects. Here's setup instructions. Download Ubuntu from https://ubuntu.com/download . Create a bootable USB with https://rufus.ie or any other software. Install Ubuntu from your USB, preferably alongside the current OS (like Windows). Install Geany: sudo apt install geany Configure Geany preferences: 5.1. Open preferences with ctrl+alt+P. 5.2. In Keybindings tab, set Switch to Editor as F1 and confirm overriding, then Switch to VTE as F2 (VTE is built-in terminal). 5.3. In Terminal tab, mark Follow path of the current file . Terminal will now automatically change a path after you open a new file. 5.4. (optional) In Editor tab, change Comment toggle marker to an empty string or a single space. Open any C++ file in Geany, go to Build > Set Build Commands and copy my flags. Compile (F8): g++ -std=c++17 -Wshadow -Wall -o \"%e\" \"%f\" -O2 -Wno-unused-result Build (F9): g++ -std=c++17 -Wshadow -Wall -o \"%e\" \"%f\" -g -fsanitize=address -fsanitize=undefined -D_GLIBCXX_DEBUG If your computer beeps after compilation, unmark Beep on errors in Preferences > General > Miscellaneous. Open a file ~/.bashrc and uncomment a line #force_color_prompt=yes in order to get colorful terminal in Geany. Restart geany or run source ~/.bashrc to trigger the change. Optional steps that I use: Hide Toolbar and Sidebar by unmarking them in View . Install Guake: sudo apt install guake Open system settings (top-right corner of the screen) and mark Auto-hide the Dock in Dock tab. More info and details below. You can install stuff by using Software Center or typing a command in terminal, usually sudo apt install program_name . This should be displayed if you just type geany ( Command 'geany' not found, but can be installed with: sudo apt install geany ). If this doesn't work, I usually google ubuntu how to install program_name from terminal and follow the instructions. Guake allows you to summon a fullscreen terminal by clicking the F12 button, which is more comfortable than a new terminal window that you can open with ctrl+alt+T. It isn't important if you use Geany built-in terminal though. Comment toggle marker refers to a special character added to comments created with shortcut ctrl+E in Geany. The default ~ means that commented lines will look like //~ int a = 2 + 2; . It's ok to get rid of the ~ character. In Preferences > Interface, you can switch the position of Geany terminal (and message window) between bottom and right. python3 is likely already installed, consider defining python as the same command ( more info ) in terminal: update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/python python /usr/bin/python3 10","title":"Linux setup"},{"location":"Plans/","text":"Video ideas \u00b6 Around 3 bitwise operations lectures.
